Time spent:  5 hours

1) Deployed dionaea honeypot.

2) Issues I encountered would be with installation.  The https://github.com/RedolentSun/mhn.git repo 
referenced a repo that was made private so I had to change a .sh file to a different repo to be able 
to properly install the VM.

3) There were 1207 attacks.

4) No unresolved questions.
